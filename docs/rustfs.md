# RustFS Backend

Status: optional S3-compatible provider profile, not a metadata or namespace
architecture.

RustFS is one S3-compatible object provider for NoKV artifact blocks. It does
not own namespace metadata, root placement, revision reachability, or garbage
collection policy.

## Boundary

```text
native full CLI / Python SDK / lower-level Rust SDK
  -> NoKV metadata and publication service
  -> S3-compatible object interface
  -> RustFS
```

NoKV sends immutable block puts, ranged gets, integrity checks, and fenced
deletes through the common object package. The NoKV metadata schema remains the
authority for paths, manifests, references, operations, and deletion
eligibility. Holt is the current serving local metadata adapter.

## Deployment Identity

Treat these values as one reviewed deployment profile:

```text
endpoint
region
bucket
access identity
credential source
TLS and certificate policy
path-style or virtual-host addressing
multipart limits
request timeout and retry policy
```

Credentials are supplied by environment or a secret manager and must not be
written into metadata, manifests, logs, examples, or object keys.

The durable block key remains:

```text
nokv/artifacts/{logical_shard_id}/{root_id}/{artifact_revision_id}/blocks/{object_index}
```

Changing the endpoint or physical RustFS node does not change that identity.

The bucket plus configured prefix contains one immutable, provider-neutral
identity marker:

```text
nokv/system/object-namespace
```

The control plane binds each `RootId` to the marker's `ObjectNamespaceId`
exactly once. Routes carry that ID, and the Holt root fence persists it in the
same metadata authority that enforces placement generation and owner epoch.
Endpoint, bucket, prefix, and credentials remain deployment configuration; NoKV
does not copy provider-specific values into metadata.

Consequently, two healthy RustFS prefixes are not interchangeable. A process
configured with the wrong prefix observes a different or absent marker and is
rejected before it can publish a route or use that provider for artifact or
lifecycle operations. A changed endpoint is safe only when it resolves to the
same durable namespace marker.

## Required Bucket Behavior

Before serving business writes, NoKV runs endpoint-specific write-conformance
admission using reserved, unreferenced system keys. The current v1 profile
verifies:

- a fresh single-PUT create-if-absent;
- an exact-byte replay and a different-byte collision;
- whole-object readback and an exact ranged read;
- a concurrent different-byte create race with exactly one stored winner.

The admission receipt is scoped to the exact provider handle and exercised
single-PUT profile: the handle owns an immutable connection profile, and the
receipt records the maximum object size exercised by the probe. A provider
name or a static `true` capability is insufficient; another handle or a block
above that profile is rejected. Multipart upload, completion, and abort are not
qualified by admission v1 and must remain fail-closed until a separate endpoint
probe covers them.

The deployment must additionally ensure:

- timeout and retry settings preserve ambiguous outcomes for reconciliation;
- lifecycle policies cannot delete reachable NoKV objects independently;
- bucket listing is not required for metadata recovery or reachability.

NoKV should use a dedicated bucket or an exclusive prefix with a policy that
prevents writes outside that boundary.

## Local Development

A local RustFS deployment is suitable for integration tests when the test
records:

- exact RustFS image or binary version;
- endpoint and TLS mode;
- clean or reused data directory;
- bucket initialization;
- NoKV durability profile;
- injected provider failures.

Keep RustFS data and Holt metadata in separate durable directories. Removing
one does not safely reset the other; create a fresh paired test deployment
instead of mixing prior metadata with an empty object directory.

The checked-in local launcher uses a Docker-managed volume by default because
the pinned RustFS image runs as non-root UID/GID `10001:10001`. An explicit
`NOKV_WORKBENCH_RUSTFS_DATA_DIR` host bind mount is supported only when that
directory is already writable by the container user. CI gates use isolated
named volumes; the gate or workflow cleanup removes them after qualification.

## Compatibility Evidence

One executed compatibility probe against Homebrew MinIO
`RELEASE.2025-09-06T17-38-46Z` was classified as inconclusive and stopped
before business publication. That result applies only to the exercised binary,
configuration, and run; it is not a claim about every MinIO release or
deployment.

## Failure Semantics

Publication follows object-first, metadata-last ordering:

1. upload blocks;
2. verify completion evidence;
3. publish metadata;
4. acknowledge the deterministic result.

If metadata publication fails, staged-object records drive cleanup. If delete
completion is uncertain, the operation enters quarantine and reconciliation.
The system does not infer success from a later bucket listing.

Temporary provider failures remain retryable across the object, client, and
Workbench error boundaries. After bounded attempts, callers receive
`ObjectUnavailable` with `retryable: true` and an attempt count. Public
provider-admission errors and ambiguous create/delete errors do not include
endpoint, bucket, prefix, or physical object keys. Immutable create and delete
operations with ambiguous completion remain reconciliation cases rather than
blind retries.

## Provisioned namespaces

`provision` derives or loads the root's immutable object namespace from the
selected formatted metadata store, creates the provider marker, and verifies
the exact namespace before making the root Ready. It does not infer or adopt a
namespace from bucket listing.

There is no implicit legacy-adoption mode. An unbound historical deployment
must be migrated by a separately reviewed offline procedure; changing the
runtime's bucket, endpoint, or prefix cannot silently redefine its object
authority.

## Qualification

Full RustFS qualification still requires:

- single and multipart publication;
- exact and ranged reads;
- checksum and length mismatch;
- timeout before and after provider completion;
- abort and staged cleanup;
- zero-reference deletion;
- ambiguous-delete reconciliation;
- process restart and owner replacement;
- healthy wrong-prefix rejection without owner-epoch or payload mutation;
- provider outage returning a redacted retryable error and the same logical
  request succeeding after provider recovery;
- throughput and latency under the declared payload/concurrency matrix.

Retain raw evidence using [Benchmarks](./benchmarks.md) and
[Workspace Acceptance](./development/workspace-acceptance.md).
An endpoint admission receipt qualifies only the exercised single-PUT and
range-read contract. It does not by itself qualify multipart behavior, exact
crash recovery, process restart, owner replacement, or ambiguous-completion
reconciliation.
